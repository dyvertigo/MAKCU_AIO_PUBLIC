Hi,

I hope this message finds you well! I've been working on enhancing the MAKCU_AIO project and would like to fork it publicly on GitHub as an open-source contribution.

## Quick Overview

I've added several new features to improve usability:
- **Setup Wizard** - Step-by-step guided setup for beginners
- **Enhanced Device Manager** - Easier device detection and management
- **Dual Interface** - Both wizard mode and original/ more advanced mode available
- **Professional Documentation** - Complete guides and setup instructions

The fork maintains all original functionality while adding these community-friendly features.

## Permission Request - Firmware Server Usage

### **Firmware Server Usage**

Currently, my fork is configured to use the original MAKCU firmware servers for automatic downloads:
- `https://github.com/terrafirma2021/MAKCM_v2_files/`
- `https://gitee.com/terrafirma/MAKCM_v2_files/`

Specifically for:
- `V3.2_LEFT.bin`
- `V3.4_RIGHT.bin`
- `config.json`

**My Question:** Is it okay for my fork to continue using these servers, or would you prefer I host these files independently?

Also, I'm really enjoying working on this project - if you have any features in mind, roadmap items, or challenging problems you'd like someone to tackle, I'd be happy to contribute! Always looking for interesting problems to solve.

### **Two Options:**

**Option A:** Continue using your servers (with your permission)
- Gives proper credit to original project
- Ensures users get official firmware
- Simpler for maintenance

**Option B:** Host files independently
- If you prefer, I can create my own `MAKCU_FILES` repository
- Would need the `.bin` firmware files from you
- Completely independent infrastructure

## Credits & Licensing

- ✅ All original credits will be maintained
- ✅ Using MIT License (permissive open-source)
